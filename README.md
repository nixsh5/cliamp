# CLIAMP

A retro terminal music player inspired by Winamp 2.x. Plays MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, AAC, ALAC, Opus, and WMA with a 10-band spectrum visualizer, 10-band parametric EQ, and playlist management.

Built with [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss), and [Beep](https://github.com/gopxl/beep).

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjarneo/cliamp/HEAD/install.sh | sh
```

## Build

```sh
go build -o cliamp .
```

## Usage

```sh
./cliamp *.mp3 *.flac *.wav *.ogg
./cliamp ~/Music                   # recursively finds all audio files
./cliamp ~/Music/jazz ~/Music/rock # multiple folders
./cliamp ~/Music song.mp3          # mix folders and files
```

## Run in dev

```sh
go run . track.mp3 song.flac
go run . ~/Music/album
```

## HTTP Streaming

Play audio directly from URLs or M3U playlists:

```sh
./cliamp https://example.com/song.mp3
./cliamp http://radio-station.com/stream.m3u
./cliamp local.mp3 https://example.com/remote.mp3   # mix local + remote
```

For non-seekable HTTP streams, the UI shows `● Streaming` with a static seek bar, and seek keys are silently ignored.

## Podcasts

Play any podcast by passing its RSS feed URL:

```sh
./cliamp https://example.com/podcast/feed.xml
```

Episode titles and the podcast name are extracted from the feed and shown in the playlist.

## YouTube, SoundCloud & Bandcamp (yt-dlp)

Play from YouTube, SoundCloud, and Bandcamp URLs if [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is installed:

```sh
./cliamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
./cliamp https://soundcloud.com/artist/track
./cliamp https://artist.bandcamp.com/album/name
```

Playlists and albums are supported. Press `S` to save a downloaded track to `~/Music/cliamp/`.

**Use at your own risk.** Downloading or streaming copyrighted content may violate the terms of service of these platforms. You are responsible for how you use this feature.

## Navidrome

Connect to a [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome)) server via environment variables:

```sh
export NAVIDROME_URL="https://your-server.com"
export NAVIDROME_USER="your-username"
export NAVIDROME_PASS="your-password"
./cliamp
```

The app starts in provider mode, letting you browse and play your Navidrome playlists.

### ffmpeg (optional)

AAC, ALAC (`.m4a`), Opus, and WMA playback requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed:

```sh
# Arch
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

MP3, WAV, FLAC, and OGG work without ffmpeg.

## Configuration

Copy the example config to get started:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/cliamp
cp config.toml.example ~/.config/cliamp/config.toml
```

```toml

# Repeat mode: "off", "all", or "one"

mono = false

# EQ preset: "Flat", "Rock", "Pop", "Jazz", "Classical",
#             "Bass Boost", "Treble Boost", "Vocal", "Electronic", "Acoustic"
